# Falling trees in Pixel using box2d

A small demo showing a bunch of tree sprites falling onto a base that isn't quite big enough to hold them all. Pixel is used to drive the graphics with box2d performing the physics simulation.

Use the mouse wheel to scroll out. Check out the trees that fell off the base and are now falling forever. Left click to recentre the view.

Run like this:

    go run falling/main.go
